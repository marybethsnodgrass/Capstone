"No Bad Apples" is a web application for keeping track of produce and their expiration dates. This app was built using AngularJS, Moment.js, and Firebase. Items added to your inventory will be green when still good, and will turn red when they are past their expiration date. Items in inventory are ordered by their "best by" date. Once a food item has been either eaten or thrown out, the trash icon will allow users to remove this item from their inventory.
